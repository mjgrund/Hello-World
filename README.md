# Hello-World

Hi Humans, I'm an old Electrical Engineer who did a fair amount of coding in the past but has been out of that world for a while.  I'm tinkering with raspberry pi and dabbling with coding a bit in what little spare time I have to see what it can do.  I'm also a homebrewer and and learning about BrewPi while waiting for my order to arrive :)
